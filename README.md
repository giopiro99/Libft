# libft

libft is a foundational C library developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It reimplements a set of standard C library functions and provides additional utility functions to help build more complex projects. This project enhances understanding of C programming, memory management, and software modularity.

## Features

- Reimplementation of common libc functions such as `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_memset`, etc.
- Additional utility functions for string manipulation, memory handling, and linked lists.
- Robust handling of edge cases and memory safety.
- Well-structured and documented code for educational purposes.

## Purpose

The libft project aims to give students a solid base of reusable C functions, reinforcing fundamental programming concepts and preparing them for more advanced projects at 42.
